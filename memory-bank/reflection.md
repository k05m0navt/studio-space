# Task Reflection: Finish Studio Space MVP (Post Phase 2)

## Summary
Implementation progressed through Phases 1-2. Security/data layers are aligned via a unified Prisma client; auth routes are split; admin APIs enforce RBAC. Booking flow now reuses a single `BookingForm` component with i18n and locale-aware navigation; availability API is used to disable time slots. Remaining gap: gallery image optimization and tests/CSP tightening.

## Implementation Review (vs Plan)
- Admin RBAC: Enforced via `requireRole(['ADMIN'])` in admin APIs.
  - See:
    - app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts
    - app/api/admin/users/route.ts
    - app/api/admin/stats/route.ts
- Prisma unification: `@/lib/prisma` is used across APIs and in `lib/auth.ts`; direct `new PrismaClient()` removed.
  - See wrapper: lib/prisma.ts
  - Auth helper: lib/auth.ts now imports `{ prisma }` from `@/lib/prisma`.
- Auth endpoints: Split into dedicated routes.
  - See: app/api/auth/login/route.ts, app/api/auth/register/route.ts; `app/api/auth/route.ts` returns 404.
- Booking APIs: POST validates and prevents conflicts; GET is protected; availability endpoint returns unavailable slots.
  - See:
    - app/api/bookings/route.ts
    - app/api/bookings/availability/route.ts
    - app/api/bookings/confirm/route.ts
- Admin UI: Uses token from `/api/auth/login`, stores in `localStorage`, forwards to localized admin proxy routes with Authorization header.
  - See: app/[locale]/admin/page.tsx
- Booking UI: Unified.
  - `app/[locale]/book/page.tsx` now renders `components/booking-form`.
  - `components/booking-form.tsx` uses `useTranslations('booking')`, `@/i18n/routing` router, and availability API.
- Gallery: Uses `motion.img` instead of `next/image`/`OptimizedImage`; assets are already WebP.
  - See: app/[locale]/gallery/page.tsx

## What Went Well
- Prisma unification complete; single client via `@/lib/prisma` (including `lib/auth.ts`).
- Auth routes split; clear contracts for `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register`.
- RBAC enforced consistently in admin endpoints and bookings GET.
- Booking UI unified and localized; availability accurately disables slots.

## Challenges
- Ensuring no stray `new PrismaClient()` usages (fixed `app/api/content/route.ts`).
- Keeping i18n keys consistent between form variants during unification.
- Image optimization pending in gallery.

## Lessons Learned
- Consolidate data/auth layers first; then unify UI to reduce duplicated effort.
- Dedicated route files improve clarity and testing strategy.
- Localized router wrappers simplify navigation logic compared to manual path handling.

## Process Improvements
- Build after each phase; add minimal endpoint smoke tests to CI.
- Standardize JSON response helpers across routes.
- Add contract tests for auth, bookings, and admin stats.

## Technical Improvements
- Replace `motion.img` with `next/image` or `components/optimized-image` in gallery; include sizes and `sizes` prop.
- Add Jest + RTL smoke tests for auth/login, bookings POST conflict, and admin stats aggregation.
- Consider extracting shared error/JSON response util.

## Next Steps
1. Optimize gallery images using `next/image`/`OptimizedImage` with WebP and proper `sizes`.
2. Add smoke tests (auth, bookings, admin stats) and integrate into CI.
3. Review CSP to reduce `unsafe-eval` if compatible.

## Deployment Reflection: Prisma Client generation on Vercel (2025-08-12)

### Summary
Vercel build failed with PrismaClientInitializationError due to cached dependencies skipping Prisma Client generation. We added `prisma generate` to `postinstall` and prefixed the `build` script to ensure the client is generated during every deploy.

### What Went Well
- Rapid diagnosis from Vercel logs pointing to Prisma generation.
- Single Prisma entrypoint via `@/lib/prisma` kept the fix surface minimal.

### Challenges
- Vercel caching caused an outdated Prisma Client to be used at build time.
- Deployment branch mismatch: Vercel targets `master` while changes were on `dev`.

### Lessons Learned
- Always run `prisma generate` on Vercel builds; include it in `postinstall` and `build`.
- Keep build scripts deterministic and idempotent to play well with caching.

### Process Improvements
- Add CI check to run `prisma generate` and fail if generation is missing or output changed.
- Document Vercel build commands in project setup to avoid regressions.

### Technical Improvements
- Keep `prisma` and `@prisma/client` versions aligned and pinned to minimize cache inconsistencies.
- Ensure Prisma Client output path `app/generated/prisma` remains stable across builds.

### Next Steps
- Merge `dev` into `master` or update Vercel to deploy the `dev` branch.
- Trigger a redeploy and confirm successful build.
- Add minimal endpoint smoke tests to CI to catch deployment regressions early.

# Task Reflection: Booking Flow E2E + Gallery Optimization

## Summary
Converted the booking page to a Server Component rendering the client `BookingForm`, confirmed i18n usage and availability wiring in the form, and optimized gallery images by switching from `motion.img` to `OptimizedImage` with responsive sizing. Build succeeded.

## What Went Well
- Booking flow UI unified and localized; availability disables slots via `/api/bookings/availability`.
- Server Component wrapper for booking page reduces client JS.
- Gallery now uses optimized images with lazy loading and blur placeholder.

## Challenges
- Preserving hover/overlay animations while switching to `OptimizedImage`.
- Ensuring locale-aware navigation still works after refactor.

## Lessons Learned
- Keep page-level components server-rendered when possible; isolate client logic to small components.
- Encapsulating image concerns in `OptimizedImage` simplifies future migrations.

## Process Improvements
- Add a quick manual smoke-test checklist for both locales (booking submit + success navigation).
- Capture a standard image sizing guide for gallery cards.

## Technical Improvements
- Add unit tests for booking POST conflict and availability mapping.
- Consider reducing framer-motion on large image grids if it impacts Web Vitals.

## Next Steps
- Manually verify booking success flow in `en` and `ru`.
- Add Jest + RTL tests for bookings and auth.
- Evaluate CSP tightening once tests are in place.
# Task Reflection: Admin Login Wiring
## PLAN: Admin Login Wiring (Level 3)

## Summary
Implemented real admin login via POST /api/auth/login with JWT issuance and persisted session. Admin UI stores token and uses authorizedFetch; locale proxies forward Authorization. RBAC enforced on admin APIs. Build succeeded.

## What Went Well
- Centralized header injection via authorizedFetch
- Clear error handling and toasts for 401/403
- Thin locale-aware proxy routes kept client paths stable

## Challenges
- Ensuring consistent role casing (ADMIN/admin)
- Coordinating localStorage state and UI gating without flicker

## Lessons Learned
- Keep auth helpers co-located with consumer or in tiny lib to minimize coupling
- Validate session on mount to reduce invalid state windows

## Process Improvements
- Add integration test for login + authorized admin fetch
- Extract shared JSON/error helpers for API routes

## Technical Improvements
- Consider httpOnly cookie for admin auth in future
- Add token refresh/short TTL with rolling sessions

## Next Steps
- Archive task and link document
- Plan cookie-based auth migration (optional)


### Requirements
- [x] Use `POST /api/auth/login` to authenticate and receive `{ token, user }`
- [x] Store JWT in `localStorage` as `adminToken` and set `adminAuth=authenticated`
- [x] Attach `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to all admin fetches
- [x] Handle 401/403 by clearing token, showing login form, and surfacing i18n toast
- [x] Keep locale-aware admin proxy routes; forward headers intact
- [x] Use `messages/*` i18n keys for auth toasts and states

### Components Affected
- `app/[locale]/admin/page.tsx`
- `app/[locale]/api/admin/{bookings,users,stats}/route.ts` (verify header forwarding)
- `lib/auth.ts` (no change required for this task)
- `messages/{en,ru}.json` (strings already present)

### Architecture Considerations
- Introduce a small client helper to centralize token header injection and 401 handling:
  - `authorizedFetch(input, init?)` → adds `Authorization` header if token exists; on 401/403 clears auth storage and returns an error shape
  - `getAuthHeaders()` → returns `{ Authorization: Bearer <token> } | {}`
- Keep token in `localStorage` for now (future: httpOnly cookie)
- Use locale-aware paths for client fetches (existing proxies)

### Implementation Strategy
1. Add `authorizedFetch` and `getAuthHeaders` inside `app/[locale]/admin/page.tsx` (scoped for now) or a tiny `lib/client-auth.ts`.
2. Update `AdminLoginForm` submit to also persist `user` as `adminUser` (stringified) and keep existing token/adminAuth writes.
3. Replace direct `fetch` calls in `loadDashboardData` with `authorizedFetch` and handle unauthorized by:
   - Clearing token/admin flags
   - `setIsAuthenticated(false)` and showing login form
   - Toast `auth.sessionExpired` or `common.unauthorized`
4. On mount, if token present, attempt a lightweight authorized call (e.g., stats) to validate session; fallback to login on 401.
5. Ensure proxy routes keep forwarding `Authorization` (already implemented); no changes expected.
6. Add minimal JSDoc comments for helpers and key functions.

### Detailed Steps
- [x] Create `authorizedFetch` + `getAuthHeaders`
- [x] Store `user` in `localStorage` on successful login
- [x] Migrate admin data fetches to `authorizedFetch`
- [x] Add 401/403 handling: clear storage, set unauthenticated, toast
- [x] Validate session on mount via a single authorized call

### Dependencies
- `JWT_SECRET` set in environment (server)
- Working endpoints: `/api/auth/login`, `/api/admin/{bookings,users,stats}`

### Challenges & Mitigations
- Token expiry / invalidation → centralized 401 handler resets state and prompts login
- UI state flicker on re-auth → gate data loads behind `isAuthenticated`, show spinner while validating

### Status
- [x] Planning complete
- [x] Implementation complete

### Next Mode
- ARCHIVE

# Task Reflection: Security & Test Coverage (Level 2)

## Summary
Added Jest + ts-jest with ESM, polyfilled fetch APIs for route tests, wrote unit tests for bookings POST, admin stats GET, and auth login POST. Tightened CSP by removing \unsafe-eval\ while keeping app functional. All tests pass; build succeeds.

## What Went Well
- Direct invocation of route handlers kept tests fast and deterministic
- Prisma access mocked via spies; JWT/session path validated for admin
- CSP tightening did not break build/runtime

## Challenges
- Jest ESM + ts-jest config required enabling useESM and alias mapping
- Admin stats route uses RBAC; needed to mock prisma.session.findUnique and sign JWT
- Bcrypt compare had to be mocked to avoid hashing in tests

## Lessons Learned
- Favor small, isolated tests around route handlers using web-standard Request/Response
- Establish a consistent auth/session mock pattern for RBAC-protected routes
- Keep CSP strict by default; extend only as needed

## Process Improvements
- Add these tests to CI with `yarn build && yarn test --ci --runInBand`
- Create a shared test util to build authorized Request with JWT/session mocks

## Technical Improvements
- Consider moving JSON/error helpers to a shared util for consistent responses
- Explore removing \unsafe-inline\ by adopting non-inline scripts/styles where possible

## Next Steps
- Archive this task and link docs
- Evaluate migrating to cookie-based admin auth in future
