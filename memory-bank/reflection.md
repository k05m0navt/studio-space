# Task Reflection: Finish Studio Space MVP (Post Phase 2)

## Summary
Implementation progressed through Phases 1-2. Security/data layers are aligned via a unified Prisma client; auth routes are split; admin APIs enforce RBAC. Booking flow now reuses a single `BookingForm` component with i18n and locale-aware navigation; availability API is used to disable time slots. Remaining gap: gallery image optimization and tests/CSP tightening.

## Implementation Review (vs Plan)
- Admin RBAC: Enforced via `requireRole(['ADMIN'])` in admin APIs.
  - See:
    - app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts
    - app/api/admin/users/route.ts
    - app/api/admin/stats/route.ts
- Prisma unification: `@/lib/prisma` is used across APIs and in `lib/auth.ts`; direct `new PrismaClient()` removed.
  - See wrapper: lib/prisma.ts
  - Auth helper: lib/auth.ts now imports `{ prisma }` from `@/lib/prisma`.
- Auth endpoints: Split into dedicated routes.
  - See: app/api/auth/login/route.ts, app/api/auth/register/route.ts; `app/api/auth/route.ts` returns 404.
- Booking APIs: POST validates and prevents conflicts; GET is protected; availability endpoint returns unavailable slots.
  - See:
    - app/api/bookings/route.ts
    - app/api/bookings/availability/route.ts
    - app/api/bookings/confirm/route.ts
- Admin UI: Uses token from `/api/auth/login`, stores in `localStorage`, forwards to localized admin proxy routes with Authorization header.
  - See: app/[locale]/admin/page.tsx
- Booking UI: Unified.
  - `app/[locale]/book/page.tsx` now renders `components/booking-form`.
  - `components/booking-form.tsx` uses `useTranslations('booking')`, `@/i18n/routing` router, and availability API.
- Gallery: Uses `motion.img` instead of `next/image`/`OptimizedImage`; assets are already WebP.
  - See: app/[locale]/gallery/page.tsx

## What Went Well
- Prisma unification complete; single client via `@/lib/prisma` (including `lib/auth.ts`).
- Auth routes split; clear contracts for `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register`.
- RBAC enforced consistently in admin endpoints and bookings GET.
- Booking UI unified and localized; availability accurately disables slots.

## Challenges
- Ensuring no stray `new PrismaClient()` usages (fixed `app/api/content/route.ts`).
- Keeping i18n keys consistent between form variants during unification.
- Image optimization pending in gallery.

## Lessons Learned
- Consolidate data/auth layers first; then unify UI to reduce duplicated effort.
- Dedicated route files improve clarity and testing strategy.
- Localized router wrappers simplify navigation logic compared to manual path handling.

## Process Improvements
- Build after each phase; add minimal endpoint smoke tests to CI.
- Standardize JSON response helpers across routes.
- Add contract tests for auth, bookings, and admin stats.

## Technical Improvements
- Replace `motion.img` with `next/image` or `components/optimized-image` in gallery; include sizes and `sizes` prop.
- Add Jest + RTL smoke tests for auth/login, bookings POST conflict, and admin stats aggregation.
- Consider extracting shared error/JSON response util.

## Next Steps
1. Optimize gallery images using `next/image`/`OptimizedImage` with WebP and proper `sizes`.
2. Add smoke tests (auth, bookings, admin stats) and integrate into CI.
3. Review CSP to reduce `unsafe-eval` if compatible.

## Deployment Reflection: Prisma Client generation on Vercel (2025-08-12)

### Summary
Vercel build failed with PrismaClientInitializationError due to cached dependencies skipping Prisma Client generation. We added `prisma generate` to `postinstall` and prefixed the `build` script to ensure the client is generated during every deploy.

### What Went Well
- Rapid diagnosis from Vercel logs pointing to Prisma generation.
- Single Prisma entrypoint via `@/lib/prisma` kept the fix surface minimal.

### Challenges
- Vercel caching caused an outdated Prisma Client to be used at build time.
- Deployment branch mismatch: Vercel targets `master` while changes were on `dev`.

### Lessons Learned
- Always run `prisma generate` on Vercel builds; include it in `postinstall` and `build`.
- Keep build scripts deterministic and idempotent to play well with caching.

### Process Improvements
- Add CI check to run `prisma generate` and fail if generation is missing or output changed.
- Document Vercel build commands in project setup to avoid regressions.

### Technical Improvements
- Keep `prisma` and `@prisma/client` versions aligned and pinned to minimize cache inconsistencies.
- Ensure Prisma Client output path `app/generated/prisma` remains stable across builds.

### Next Steps
- Merge `dev` into `master` or update Vercel to deploy the `dev` branch.
- Trigger a redeploy and confirm successful build.
- Add minimal endpoint smoke tests to CI to catch deployment regressions early.

# Task Reflection: Booking Flow E2E + Gallery Optimization

## Summary
Converted the booking page to a Server Component rendering the client `BookingForm`, confirmed i18n usage and availability wiring in the form, and optimized gallery images by switching from `motion.img` to `OptimizedImage` with responsive sizing. Build succeeded.

## What Went Well
- Booking flow UI unified and localized; availability disables slots via `/api/bookings/availability`.
- Server Component wrapper for booking page reduces client JS.
- Gallery now uses optimized images with lazy loading and blur placeholder.

## Challenges
- Preserving hover/overlay animations while switching to `OptimizedImage`.
- Ensuring locale-aware navigation still works after refactor.

## Lessons Learned
- Keep page-level components server-rendered when possible; isolate client logic to small components.
- Encapsulating image concerns in `OptimizedImage` simplifies future migrations.

## Process Improvements
- Add a quick manual smoke-test checklist for both locales (booking submit + success navigation).
- Capture a standard image sizing guide for gallery cards.

## Technical Improvements
- Add unit tests for booking POST conflict and availability mapping.
- Consider reducing framer-motion on large image grids if it impacts Web Vitals.

## Next Steps
- Manually verify booking success flow in `en` and `ru`.
- Add Jest + RTL tests for bookings and auth.
- Evaluate CSP tightening once tests are in place.
