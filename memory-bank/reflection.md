# Task Reflection: Finish Studio Space MVP (Mid-implementation)

## Summary
Implementation is partially complete. Security and data layers are mostly aligned: admin APIs enforce RBAC and share the Prisma wrapper; booking APIs validate inputs and compute availability. Gaps remain around auth route structure, Prisma client usage in `lib/auth`, booking UI unification/i18n, and image optimization.

## Implementation Review (vs Plan)
- Admin RBAC: Enforced via `requireRole(['ADMIN'])` in admin APIs.
  - See:
    - app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts
    - app/api/admin/users/route.ts
    - app/api/admin/stats/route.ts
- Prisma unification: `@/lib/prisma` exists and is used in APIs; however `lib/auth.ts` instantiates its own `PrismaClient` (duplication risk).
  - See wrapper: lib/prisma.ts
  - Duplication: lib/auth.ts (uses `new PrismaClient()`)
- Auth endpoints: Single `app/api/auth/route.ts` multiplexes `/login` and `/register` by pathname; not yet split into dedicated route files as planned, but endpoints respond.
  - See: app/api/auth/route.ts
- Booking APIs: POST validates and prevents conflicts; GET is protected; availability endpoint returns unavailable slots.
  - See:
    - app/api/bookings/route.ts
    - app/api/bookings/availability/route.ts
    - app/api/bookings/confirm/route.ts
- Admin UI: Uses token from `/api/auth/login`, stores in `localStorage`, forwards to localized admin proxy routes with Authorization header.
  - See: app/[locale]/admin/page.tsx
- Booking UI: Duplicate flows exist. `components/booking-form.tsx` uses availability API but lacks i18n and locale-aware redirect; `app/[locale]/book/page.tsx` is i18n-aware but not wired to backend and has mocked availability.
  - See:
    - components/booking-form.tsx
    - app/[locale]/book/page.tsx
- Gallery: Uses `motion.img` instead of `next/image`/`OptimizedImage`; assets are already WebP.
  - See: app/[locale]/gallery/page.tsx

## What Went Well
- RBAC implemented consistently in admin and bookings GET endpoints.
- Prisma wrapper present; majority of APIs import it correctly.
- Availability API integrated and consumed by one booking form.
- Localized admin proxy routes simplify header/locale handling.

## Challenges
- `lib/auth.ts` creates its own Prisma client; risks multiple connections in dev/hot reload.
- Auth routes not split; future maintenance and typing are harder.
- Booking UI is duplicated; only one variant uses availability API and neither is fully i18n-correct end-to-end.
- Image optimization pending in gallery.

## Lessons Learned
- Finish data-layer consolidation before expanding UI changes.
- Centralize auth/session verification to a single Prisma instance.
- Prefer dedicated routes over pathname branching for clarity and DX.

## Process Improvements
- Validate each phase with a build + minimal smoke tests before moving on.
- Share a single error/JSON response helper across routes.
- Add lightweight contract tests for critical APIs (auth, bookings, admin stats).

## Technical Improvements
- Refactor `lib/auth.ts` to import `{ prisma }` from `@/lib/prisma` and remove `new PrismaClient()`.
- Split auth into `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` and `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` with shared Zod schemas.
- Unify booking UI by rendering `components/booking-form` in `app/[locale]/book/page.tsx`; add i18n via `useTranslations('booking')` and use locale-aware `useRouter` for redirects.
- Replace `motion.img` with `next/image` or `components/optimized-image` in gallery; include sizes.

## Next Steps
1. Update `lib/auth.ts` to use the shared Prisma wrapper.
2. Create dedicated auth route files and migrate logic from the multiplexed route.
3. Refactor `app/[locale]/book/page.tsx` to reuse `components/booking-form`; internationalize the form and fix locale redirect.
4. Swap gallery images to `next/image`/`OptimizedImage` with width/height or responsive sizes.
5. Run build and add smoke tests for auth, bookings, and admin stats.
