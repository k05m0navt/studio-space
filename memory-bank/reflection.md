# Task Reflection: Finish Studio Space MVP (Post Phase 2)

## Summary
Implementation progressed through Phases 1-2. Security/data layers are aligned via a unified Prisma client; auth routes are split; admin APIs enforce RBAC. Booking flow now reuses a single `BookingForm` component with i18n and locale-aware navigation; availability API is used to disable time slots. Remaining gap: gallery image optimization and tests/CSP tightening.

## Implementation Review (vs Plan)
- Admin RBAC: Enforced via `requireRole(['ADMIN'])` in admin APIs.
  - See:
    - app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts
    - app/api/admin/users/route.ts
    - app/api/admin/stats/route.ts
- Prisma unification: `@/lib/prisma` is used across APIs and in `lib/auth.ts`; direct `new PrismaClient()` removed.
  - See wrapper: lib/prisma.ts
  - Auth helper: lib/auth.ts now imports `{ prisma }` from `@/lib/prisma`.
- Auth endpoints: Split into dedicated routes.
  - See: app/api/auth/login/route.ts, app/api/auth/register/route.ts; `app/api/auth/route.ts` returns 404.
- Booking APIs: POST validates and prevents conflicts; GET is protected; availability endpoint returns unavailable slots.
  - See:
    - app/api/bookings/route.ts
    - app/api/bookings/availability/route.ts
    - app/api/bookings/confirm/route.ts
- Admin UI: Uses token from `/api/auth/login`, stores in `localStorage`, forwards to localized admin proxy routes with Authorization header.
  - See: app/[locale]/admin/page.tsx
- Booking UI: Unified.
  - `app/[locale]/book/page.tsx` now renders `components/booking-form`.
  - `components/booking-form.tsx` uses `useTranslations('booking')`, `@/i18n/routing` router, and availability API.
- Gallery: Uses `motion.img` instead of `next/image`/`OptimizedImage`; assets are already WebP.
  - See: app/[locale]/gallery/page.tsx

## What Went Well
- Prisma unification complete; single client via `@/lib/prisma` (including `lib/auth.ts`).
- Auth routes split; clear contracts for `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/register`.
- RBAC enforced consistently in admin endpoints and bookings GET.
- Booking UI unified and localized; availability accurately disables slots.

## Challenges
- Ensuring no stray `new PrismaClient()` usages (fixed `app/api/content/route.ts`).
- Keeping i18n keys consistent between form variants during unification.
- Image optimization pending in gallery.

## Lessons Learned
- Consolidate data/auth layers first; then unify UI to reduce duplicated effort.
- Dedicated route files improve clarity and testing strategy.
- Localized router wrappers simplify navigation logic compared to manual path handling.

## Process Improvements
- Build after each phase; add minimal endpoint smoke tests to CI.
- Standardize JSON response helpers across routes.
- Add contract tests for auth, bookings, and admin stats.

## Technical Improvements
- Replace `motion.img` with `next/image` or `components/optimized-image` in gallery; include sizes and `sizes` prop.
- Add Jest + RTL smoke tests for auth/login, bookings POST conflict, and admin stats aggregation.
- Consider extracting shared error/JSON response util.

## Next Steps
1. Optimize gallery images using `next/image`/`OptimizedImage` with WebP and proper `sizes`.
2. Add smoke tests (auth, bookings, admin stats) and integrate into CI.
3. Review CSP to reduce `unsafe-eval` if compatible.
