# Task Archive: Booking Flow E2E + Gallery Optimization

## Metadata
- **Complexity**: Level 3 (Feature)

## Summary
Converted the booking page to a Server Component that renders the client `BookingForm`, confirmed i18n usage and availability wiring in the form, and optimized gallery images by replacing `motion.img` with `OptimizedImage` for better performance (lazy loading, blur placeholder, sizes). Production build succeeded.

## Requirements
- i18n-ready booking form uses `/api/bookings` and `/api/bookings/availability`.
- Success redirect uses locale-aware router to `/booking-success`.
- Replace gallery images with `OptimizedImage`/`next/image` using WebP assets and proper sizes.

## Implementation
### Approach
- Keep page component server-rendered, encapsulate client behavior in small components.
- Use existing `OptimizedImage` for responsive, lazy-loaded images with placeholders.

### Key Components
- Booking UI: `app/[locale]/book/page.tsx` (Server Component wrapper) → `components/booking-form.tsx` (client).
- Gallery UI: `app/[locale]/gallery/page.tsx`.

### Files Changed
- `/Users/k05m0navt/Work/VashaStudio/studio-space/app/[locale]/book/page.tsx`: Removed `'use client'` so page is server-rendered.
- `/Users/k05m0navt/Work/VashaStudio/studio-space/app/[locale]/gallery/page.tsx`: Replaced `motion.img` with `OptimizedImage`; kept overlay/hover animations.

## Testing
- Build: `yarn build` SUCCESS (only swagger-jsdoc warning).
- Manual: Verified gallery renders with hover overlay; booking form submits to `/api/bookings` and reads availability.

## Lessons Learned
- Favor Server Components for pages; limit client-side code.
- Centralized image component simplifies future optimizations and consistency.
